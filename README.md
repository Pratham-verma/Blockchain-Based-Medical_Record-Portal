## Features

- Patient-centric system allowing patients to control access to their data
- Secure storage of healthcare records on the blockchain
- IPFS integration for storing files like reports and X-rays
- User classification into five categories: Owner, Hospitals, Insurance Company, Doctor, and Patient
- Granular access control for patients to grant or revoke data access permissions
